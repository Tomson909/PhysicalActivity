# Dataset Characteristics
As the prevalence of wearable devices like smartwatches, smartphones, and wristbands continues to rise, there is an increasing demand to decipher user behavior and discern patterns in their activities. To tackle this challenge, we harnessed the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset, which originally captured data from 18 distinct physical activities (e.g., walking, cycling, playing soccer) performed by 9 subjects equipped with 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor.

This dataset proves invaluable for tasks such as activity recognition, intensity estimation, and the development of algorithms for data processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. To enhance its accessibility, I've made transformative changes to the original data, introducing a new "PeopleId" column and consolidating all datasets into a comprehensive CSV file.

Leveraging this enriched dataset allows you to employ a classifier that accurately predicts the specific activity a user is involved in. This empowers developers and researchers to pioneer innovative applications and systems capable of comprehending and responding to individual user needs based on their ongoing activities.
