# Physical Activity Classification

## Repository Link

https://github.com/Tomson909/PhysicalActivity.git

## Description
In recent years, there has been a surge in the popularity of smartwatches and similar wearable devices designed for tracking various physical activities. These devices collect a wealth of data, including heart rate, acceleration, and more, offering valuable insights into users' exercise routines. The focus of this project is the classification of different physical activities based on the data acquired from these devices.

The dataset utilized for this project can be accessed on Kaggle via the following link: Physical Activity Dataset. [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diegosilvadefrana/fisical-activity-dataset).
