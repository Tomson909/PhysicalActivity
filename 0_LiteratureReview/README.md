**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Physical activity prediction with same dataset

  - **[Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaushalkrishna2000/physical-activity-notebook)**
  - **Objective**: Based on the same dataset the physical activity is being predicted
  - **Methods**: Simple mutilayer neural net
  - **Outcomes**: Predicted with an accuracy of 99% but the testing is unrealistic
  - **Relation to the Project**: Same project
