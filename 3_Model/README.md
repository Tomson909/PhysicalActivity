# Model Definition and Evaluation
I have tried a total of 2 models for classification. First of all a multilayer neural net and secondly an LSTM. The idea is that an LSTM basically performs an averaging over a time window. For example, anyone who has run in the last 2 minutes is most likely also running at the current time. The notebook with the models can be found here:
